OKAY SO.....

___Shazza-File___Encryption___

Here we have a nice little app for using OpenSSL to encrypt all the files in a given DIR tree or 
a single file you select in the working file (PWD). OpwnSSL has a large set of Cryto fuctions and this
 is just using the CBC ciphers! This app can be installed to the system with the --install flag and 
will then be ready for use as a nix command like any other.
To Remove the app again use --remove and it will take it off the system for you.
Will also need Zenity and OpenSSl in the system and they are not will be installed too!!

To Install....

./shazzafile --install


After done just...

shazzafile

from any place your working on the term.

To Un-Install....

./shazzafile --remove

- Enjoy

**** Pleasse be safe with you PASS as I can NOT help you if you loose your pass
your files will STAY encrypted !! ****
N.b - try it out on a test files if your not sure...
